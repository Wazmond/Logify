# Welcome to my app, Logify.

A logbook app for any vehicles to stay up to date, and to keep track of your service record digitally.

This app has helped me to learn code to where I am today, written in React Native, utilising libraries such as Redux Toolkit, UUID, and expo. 
Still more to learn and do, but I'm proud of my work and enjoy making this project, lots to improve on though.

Enjoy-
